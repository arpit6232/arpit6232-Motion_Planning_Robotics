# Potential Functions and Wave front 

## Potential Functions 
To Run the program <br /> 
Follow the following steps <br />
1) python potential_field.py <br />
2) Following Input is Needed  <br />
Enter '0' for 2-obstacle(config 1) , '1' for 5-obstacle(config 2) , '2' for 9-obstacle(config 3): <br />
'0' is part of the solution for part 2_a <br />
'1' and '2' are part of 2_b  <br />

All the above steps will begin the gradient descent, which takes a long time # Fair Warning 
for the large workspace with 9 obstacles it took 6 hours for me to gradient descent 


## Wavefront
To Run the program <br /> 
Follow the following steps <br />
1) python wavefront.py <br />
2) Following Input is Needed  <br />
0 for non-manipulator , 1 or Manipulator : <br />
if 1 is selected Q4 solution is shown as output <br />
if 0 is selected external input of following is needed  <br />
 Enter 1 for config 1 , 2 for config 2: <br />
 config 1 is the workspace with 5 obstacles <br />
 config 2 is the workspace with 9 obstacles <br />
